      <h2><b> What is Minecraft? </b></h2>
      <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021.</p>
      
      <h2> <b> Game Modes </b></h2>
      <p>There are different types of modes in Minecraft. You could choose: "<b>Survival Mode </b>, <b>Hardcore Mode </b>, <b>Creative Mode </b>, <b> Aventure Mode </b>, or either <b> Spectator Mode. </b></p>
      
      <h2><b>Development </b></h2>
      <p>Before coming up with Minecraft, Markus "Notch" Persson was a game developer with King through March 2009, at the time serving mostly browser games, during which he learnt a number of different programming languages.[98] He would prototype his own games during his off-hours at home, often based on inspiration he found from other games, and participated frequently on the TIGSource forums for independent developers.[98] One of these personal projects was called "RubyDung", a base-building game inspired by Dwarf Fortress, but as an isometric three dimensional game like RollerCoaster Tycoon.[99] He had already made a 3D texture mapper for another zombie game prototype he had started to try to emulate the style of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars.[100] Among the features in "RubyDung" he explored was a first-person view similar to Dungeon Keeper but at the time, felt the graphics were too pixelated and omitted this mode.[100][101] Around March 2009, Persson left King and joined jAlbum, but otherwise kept working on his prototypes.[102][101][103]</p>
      
      <h2><b> Minecraft: Pocket Edition </b> </h2>
      <p>In August 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Xperia Play on the Android Market as an early alpha version. It was then released for several other compatible devices on 8 October 2011.[139][140] An iOS version of Minecraft was released on 17 November 2011.[141] A port was made available for Windows Phones shortly after Microsoft acquired Mojang.[142] The port concentrates on the creative building and the primitive survival aspect of the game, and does not contain all the features of the PC release. On his Twitter account, Jens Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is written in C++ and not Java, due to iOS not being able to support Java.[143] However, there now exists a way to play Java Edition on both Android and iOS devices.[144][145] </p>

      <p> On 10 December 2014, a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1.[146] In January 2017, Microsoft announced that it would no longer maintain the Windows Phone versions of Pocket Edition.[147] On 19 December 2016, the full version of Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released on iOS, Android and Windows Phone.</p>

      <p>Pocket Edition was replaced by Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in 2017, enabling cross-platform play with the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch Editions.[148] </p>

      <h2> <b> Minecraft China </b> </h2>
      <p>On 20 May 2016, Minecraft China was announced as a localized edition for China, where it was released under a licensing agreement between NetEase and Mojang.[175] The PC edition was released for public testing on 8 August 2017. The iOS version was released on 15 September 2017, and the Android version was released on 12 October 2017.[176][177][178] The PC edition is based on the original Java Edition, while the iOS and Android mobile version is based on the Bedrock Edition. The edition is free-to-play and had over 300 million players by November 2019.[179] </p>

      <h2><b> Minecraft for Windows </b> </h2>
      <p> Minecraft for Windows is exclusive to Microsoft's Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. The beta release for Windows 10 launched on the Windows Store on July 29, 2015.[180] </p>
